# Climate Smart Seaports - Pacific

v1.0

## 1. Introduction

The Climate Smart Seaports Tool enables interested users to begin the process of a climate risk assessment. It assists them to identify current and historical climate trends and variability, as well as future climate projections under a variety of scenarios. Population and trade data is included, and users can add port-specific information to round out their analysis.

This tool is a web application that provides a portal for Seaports authorities to gather data related from various sources and put them together into reports. This is achieved by guiding the user through a risk assessment driven workflow.

### a. Get the database ready

Make sure you have MySQL installed and running.

Create the "seaports" and "seaports\_test" databases and fill them with the data. "Ready-to-use" SQL dump files are available under: *src/main/java/database/seaports_dump.sql* and *src/main/java/database/seaports_test_dump.sql*

You can also run the "main" methods in the Java files under "src/main/java/database" to programatically load the data in the databases (make sure you edit the files "hibernate.cfg.xml" and "hibernate-test.cfg.xml" to add your databases credentials before using these Java loading files).

### b. Build the application

The application uses Maven ([http://maven.apache.org/](http://maven.apache.org/)) to manage its build.  
Make sure Maven is installed and working before building the application. 

You can build the application by invoking the command `mvn install` in your terminal, from the root of the project (where the file *pom.xml* is located).

### c. Deploy the application

The application uses [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) to deploy the application.  
Make sure they are installed before deploying the application.

You can deploy the application by invoking the command `mvn -Djetty.port=8080 jetty:run` in your terminal, from the root of the project (where the file *pom.xml* is located).
