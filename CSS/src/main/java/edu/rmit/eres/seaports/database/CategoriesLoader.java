				"<h6>Future Climate &amp; Marine</h6><p class=\"justified\">The future climate context faced by ports is an important factor in future planning and risk assessment processes. Direct impacts on ports, and indirect impacts on supply chains, will impact capital investment, maintenance requirements, as well as knowledge, skill and training requirements for personnel. Understanding potential future climate impacts allows ports to adequately assess their future planning options, and accommodate the most appropriate adaptation choices. <p class=\"justified\">This tab assists ports to identify some of the future climate projections data relevant for their region. <p class=\"justified\">Global climate models were selected using CSIRO's Climate Futures tool. Projections were classified using two climate variables: rainfall and temperature, and grouped into \"climate futures\", for example \"hotter &amp; drier\" or \"cooler and wetter\". Likelihoods were then assigned according to the number of climate models that fell within each category.

				"<h6>Non-Climate Context</h6><p class=\"justified\">Non-climate data helps set the operational context of ports. It also provides a starting point for consideration of possible impacts of non-climate factors into the future. For example, population growth along the coast can constrain a port's ability to expand in the future, and to retreat as sea level rise and climatic conditions change. National population growth can also be a driver of increased activity at container import ports, which may lead to congestion problems. <p class=\"justified\">This tab identifies particular non-climate-related information.
